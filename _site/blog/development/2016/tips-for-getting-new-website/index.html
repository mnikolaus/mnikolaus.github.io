                <p>So you are getting fed up with your old website or just want to build the new one?</p>

<p>Reasons to make a new website can be numerous:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your website is really old</li>
  <li>your website is not functional</li>
  <li>your website is not following your company’s design</li>
  <li>your website’s conversion rate is just too low</li>
  <li>you want to rebrand</li>
  <li>you don’t have existing website</li>
</ul>

<p>You finally decided to build yourself a new website, but you don’t know where to start. Contact with the firm that built current website is long gone and you just don’t know the technology that good to start the thinking process.</p>

<h1 id="define-the-goals">Define the goals</h1>

<p><em>I want to drive more visitors to my website!</em></p>

<p><em>I want to increase conversion rate!</em></p>

<p><em>I want to make my website more appealing!</em></p>

<p><em>I want my website structure to be more logical!</em></p>

<p>These are all legit goals and are not so easy to accomplish. A lot of thesis had been written with their claims how to achieve each one of them. However in this article I won’t share my thoughts on this topics. Rather I will try to give you insight in thinking process behind the making of website from idea to final product.</p>

<p>So, what is the main reason you want to change your website? This is your <strong>goal</strong>. Embrace it and build everything around it, sure you have to have more than one goal, but this is your primary goal and you should put most focus on it.</p>

<h1 id="be-aware-of-the-extent-of-change">Be aware of the extent of change</h1>

<p>Note that sometimes changing your website might include changing whole bunch of stuff that is directly connected to it. For example, if you want to change the contractor which is responsible for maintance of your servers, you may need to change the whole system(i.e. email service). That being said, all of your cloud content is usually connected to one physical server where that data is stored. So before you terminate your contract with current agency or firm be sure to check all the services you signed that contract for. The worst thing that can happen to you is that you lose some data or you get out of service for a few days or even a few weeks.</p>

<p>Changing content of the webpage can drastically lower your SEO score and can reduce your page rank significantly. Let’s say that you currently have some old pages that got some audience in past and based on that audience it made to top results in search. Changing content completely will result in visitor finding broken links and for that you get penalised by search engine. To prevent this from happen just be sure that all of your content remains pretty much the same and the urls match the ones on old website.</p>

<h1 id="analyze-content-on-current-website">Analyze content on current website</h1>

<p>Analyzing current content is very important to get insight what the current website lacks. Let’s say that you have a lot of content but it is badly organized. Visitors can’t seem to find what they are looking for and this is problem. If they don’t find immidiately what they are looking for and will leave, which will in the end increase your bounce rate and decrease SEO score.</p>

<p>These questions can help you analyze your content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your website all about?</li>
  <li>What kind of visitors do you attract?</li>
  <li>Do you think your content is suitable for your target segment?</li>
  <li>Is it represented in a fashion so that they can easily understand it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Content should be unique!</strong> I can’t stress this enough. This is what makes you stand out and not gets penalised for duplicating content. You have greater chance to have unique content by writting about unique subjects. Blogs that</p>
